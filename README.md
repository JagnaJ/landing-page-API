## Blog Landing Page
## Overview
This project is a static blog landing page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a layout for displaying blog posts and a modal window for viewing detailed content.

## Technologies Used
1. HTML: Structure of the page.
2. CSS: Styling and layout.
3. JavaScript: Dynamic content loading and modal functionality.
4. JSONPlaceholder API: This mock API is used to fetch and display blog posts.
## Features
Blog Post Container: Displays a list of blog posts fetched from an API.
Modal Window: Shows detailed content of a selected post.
## How It Works
Fetching Posts: JavaScript fetches blog posts from the JSONPlaceholder API and displays them on the page.
Viewing Post Details: Clicking on a "Read More" button fetches and displays detailed content of the post in a modal window.
Modal Functionality: The modal can be closed by clicking the close button or by clicking outside the modal content.
## Running the Project
Open index.html in a web browser.
Ensure you have an internet connection for fetching posts from the API.
## Future Enhancements
Improve styling for better responsiveness.
Add more interactive features and animations.
